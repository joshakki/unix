Features of unix-

1.Multiuser capability
2.Multitasking capability
3.Communication - unix devices can easily communicate with each other.
4.Security - three levels of security 1.login and password 2.file can be given permission of read and write or only read or one can only reserve it fo r just his device 
5.Portability

Unix system organisation

it is done in three layers Shell,Kernel,applications
Application deals in compatible language with humans 
kernel is the heart of the unix that interacts with the hardware in machine language.
Shell helps in communicating between kernel and the applications.
 
UNIX FILE SYSTEM -	Root directory is denoted as slash (/). it contains all the directories and their sub, sub sub directories.
1.bin directory -it contains collection of various commands.
2.unix - it is the kernel file of the system 
3.lib - contains all the library functions 
4.dev - it contains files for various input and output devices as in unix each device is stored as a file.
5.etc - binary executable files required for system administration
6.tmp - temperoary files are stored.

touch command -it is used to create a new file of zero bytes we can also create several files at once by its help.
ex - $ touch sample sample1 sample2 sample3
if we want to add some lines to those files we need to enter 
$ cat > sample
and then add lines.
to see the contents of the line 
$ cat test

to merge contents of two files 
$ cat sample1 sample2 > sample

to merge and original file should remain as it is
$ cat sample1 sample2 >> sample
to copy a file 
$ cp sample1 sample2           
but this also overwrites the sample2 file such that the original content of the sample2 is deleted and over written by sample1 

delete a file or directory

$ rm -i <file name> 
takes confirmation before deleting a file 

$ rm -r <file name> 
 is used to delete a directory irrespective it is empty or not 

$ rm -f <file name> 
forcibly delete a file 

$ mv sample sample1 
changes the name of file from sample to sample1 

$ mv /home/a/b/sample /home/a 
moves a file from b to a 

$ ls -a 
it lists all of the file present in the working directory. it can also list the hidden files.


ls p* it shows the sub directory and the files of the directory that is having a p in its name.	

ls -l  on entering this command we get

total 86664

total 86664 denotes the total number of disk blocks that the file in current directory have occupied is 86664.

in second line leftmost character denotes the file type	

file type        meaning 
   -             ordinary file 
   d             Directory file 
   c             character special file 
   b             block special file 
   l             symbolic link  
   s             semaphore
   p             named pipe 
   m             shared memory file 		


next nine character denotes the file read write permission that the user is having  
then number of links,owner joshakki,group name,size of files in bytes,date and time of last modified and last is the file name.

$ ln sample sample1
this command provides one extra link to open a sample file by the name of sample1.

symbols        permissions       weightage
 r               read               4
 w               write              2
 x               execute            1

the rwxr-x--x is the permission listed for any file 

it can be devided as rwx,r-x,--x
 rwx denotes that file can be read written and execute by the owner and its weightage is 7.
 r-x shows that file can only be read and execute but is not available to modify by any other member its weightage is 6. 
 --x shows that all other can only execute the file and weightage is 1.

to change the file permission we have chmod command.it changes mode of the file it is executed on.
ex- chmod myfile 700

umask 

it is a command to know the default permission set for a file while creating it. if on entering umask command we get the reply as 0002.first zero shows that there is no change in permission for the owner. suppose a file is created then its default permission will be 777 - 002 = 775.
       		
changing permission of a directory 
when a intruder attempts to delete a file with permission of 754 he cannot but he can delete the directory containing the file which leads to the deletion of the file so to prevent this we need to add a sticky permission to the directory. 
 
chmod 1754 mydir 
this is the command to add directory permission with the sticky bit.
the file permission then shows as drwxrw-r--t

mkdir -p mkdir/a/b/c/d/e
this command is used to create a directory and its sub directory at once.

$bc 
this command is used for calculation 
 10/2 * 2
 10
 quit
   f
